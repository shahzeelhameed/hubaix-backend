1. First, install the node modules in the current directory by running the command: npm install -f. After the installation is successful, the node modules will be set up.

2. Next, create a new file named .env and define your environment variables in it.

3. Ensure you update the credentials in your local database configuration file (db/index.js) with the following credentials:
const db = new Pool({
    user: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    database: "yourdatabasename",
    password: yourdatabsepassword,
    port: 5432,
});

4. After making these changes, run the command npm start to start the project. If everything is set up correctly, the project should run successfully.
